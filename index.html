            <p>I'm Matt, a junior game programmer with a passion for creating 
                engaging and immersive gaming experiences. I have over two years 
                experience working in the games industry with a strong foundation in 
                C++ and Unreal Engine. I have worked on various projects from small 
                indie games to large AAA titles. Below is a showcase of some of the 
                projects I have worked on.

                    <h3>Oil Strike '75</h3>
                    <p>This is an 80s arcade-style indie game that I worked on as part of a small team of developers and got to see the full development cycle from start to finish.</p>
                    <p>The game is written entirely in C++ and makes use of a bespoke game framework.</p>
                    <p>Due to the small team nature of this project, I was responsible for contributing to several areas of development including physics, 3Câ€™s and level design.</p>
                    <p>The game is available to play for free on Steam and was also shortlisted in the 2024 TIGA Game Awards.</p>

                    <h3>Belfry</h3>
                    <p>This was a prototype I worked on that explored the concept of a 2d game world which exists within a 3d environment.</p>
                    <p>
                        I was responsible for developing many of the game 
                        engine features such as adding support for quaternions 
                        and developing a bespoke behaviour tree system.

                    <p>
                        Implementing a complete behaviour tree system 
                        presented significant technical challenges, however the 
                        system provided much greater flexibility over the use of 
                        state machines and ultimately reduced the overall 
                        workload of the team.

                    <h3>Frontier</h3>
                    <p>This is a mobile game I developed as a personal project using Unity and published to the Google Play Store.</p>
                    <p>For the game to be supported by a wide range of devices it required me to research and implement a number of features such as fixed input, touch screen controls and dynamic scaling to ensure a consistent aspect ratio.</p>
                    <p>The game also features cloud saves and utilizes the Google Play social platform to include a global leaderboard.</p>
