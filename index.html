                I'm Matt, a junior game programmer with over two years 
                experience working in the games industry. I have a strong foundation in 
                C++ and Unreal Engine and have worked on various projects from small 
                indie games to large AAA titles.

                <h3>Oil Strike '75</h3>
                <p>This is an 80s arcade-style game that I worked on as part of a small team of developers and got to see the full development cycle from start to finish.</p>
                <p>The game is written entirely in C++ and makes use of a bespoke game framework.</p>
                <p>Due to the small team nature of this project, I was responsible for contributing to several areas of development including gameplay, physics and level design.</p>
                <p>The game is available to play for free on Steam and was also shortlisted in the 2024 TIGA Game Awards.</p>

                <h3>Belfry</h3>
                <p>This was a prototype I worked on which explored the idea of a 2d game world set in a 3d environment.</p>
                <p>
                    I was responsible for developing many of the  
                    in-engine features such as adding support for quaternions 
                    and developing a bespoke behaviour tree system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implementing a complete behaviour tree system 
                    presented significant technical challenges, however the 
                    system provided much greater flexibility over the use of 
                    state machines and ultimately reduced the overall 
                    workload of the team.

                <h3>Frontier</h3>
                <p>This is a mobile game I developed as a personal project using Unity and published to the Google Play Store.</p>
                <p>The game utilises a number of mobile specific features such as touch screen controls and dynamic scaling to ensure a consistent aspect ratio across multiple devices.</p>
                <p>The game also features cloud saves and utilises the Google Play social platform to include a global leaderboard.</p>
