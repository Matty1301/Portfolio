        <div class="box">
            <p>I graduated with a master’s degree in physics and soon after began developing games in my spare time. 
                Since then, my skills have grown rapidly, both technical and professional, largely through the help of 
                the game programmer apprenticeship which I completed last year. This is an advanced level 7 qualification 
                that teaches everything from how to write well-tested maintainable C++, to the common development 
                methodologies applied in the games industry.
            </p>
            <p>During the apprenticeship I got the opportunity to work on a shipped title as part of a small team of 
                developers and see the full development cycle from start to finish. The game (Oil Strike ’75) is 
                available to play for free on Steam and was also shortlisted in the 2024 TIGA Game Awards.</p>
            <p>Since completing my apprenticeship, I have worked on multiple projects including a live-service 
                multiplayer game currently in development using Unreal Engine. As part of the AI team, I was responsible 
                for helping to create the bots that would play the game just like a human player. This means that not 
                only was I helping to create new AI behaviours, but I also gained an insight into many other areas such 
                as gameplay, animations, and networking.
            </p>
            <p>I am now looking to continue my programming career in the games industry so if you are looking for someone who is 
                self-motivated and passionate about making great games then please get in touch via LinkedIn or email me
